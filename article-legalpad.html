                  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">As owner or prospective owner of
                  a business, your own negotiations skills will be the critical element determining the
                  success or failure of the acquisition or sale of a business. Your accountant, attorney and
                  business adviser should be intimately involved with you as your agents to provide
                  information, help you create options, and set forth the structure to the agreement,
                  however you are the principal and you must have the greatest role as a formidable powerful
                  business negotiator.</font></p>
                  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You must demonstrate the
                  authority and power to enter into negotiations. There are six sources of negotiation
                  power:</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Preparation - skill, knowledge and information. </font></li>
                    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Legitimacy, credibility and trust. </font></li>
                    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Social skills to develop a positive working
                      relationship. </font></li>
                    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Commitment to resolving the issues to make a deal.
                      </font></li>
                    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Creativity in providing alternatives and options. </font></li>
                    <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Promotion of a satisfying solution that will work
                      for all parties to the negotiation.</font></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">This article deals with
                  preparation. Skill, knowledge and information are critical to effective preparation.
                  Negotiation preparation is the key to empowerment, enabling you to influence others to
                  create the deal that satisfies both your needs and the needs of all those involved. In
                  order to formulate an effective negotiation, you must strategize for success. Whether you
                  are the purchaser or the seller, the skills are essential to a successful outcome for both
                  parties.</font></p>
                  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The following framework may be
                  used to prepare for a business negotiation:</font></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Critically analyze your present
                      situation. Do this financially, socially and emotionally. What are your constraints? What
                      are your long-term goals?</font></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Identify your objectives in
                      buying or selling the business. To do this you need to consult with family, business
                      associates, an accountant, an attorney, financial advisers and business advisers to
                      provide input into the business planning. Identify economic, social and psychological
                      needs- does this particular business really satisfy those concerns? You must clarify your
                      desires to design a strategy that will identify the target.</font></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Clearly outline a tentative
                      plan that sets budgetary limits and defines positions with regard to issues that may arise
                      in the transaction. Define your reasoning behind those positions (your interests) so you
                      can create options to satisfy those interests in the event those positions are not
                      acceptable to the other side.</font></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Investigate and use due
                      diligence to find out all you can about the prospective business or prospective customer.
                      Ascertain who the owners and people in authority are. Identify the clientele, the
                      customers, the suppliers, the competitors and all those who deal directly and indirectly
                      with the company. If possible, meet with the employees and others associated with the
                      company and ask open-ended questions to find out as much as you can. Ask for financial
                      statements, brochures and all other written material about the company - any data
                      ascertained now will be a great resource to you in determining whether or not to pursue
                      the transaction.</font></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Once you have compiled

                  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Familiarize your experts with
                  your own situation and ask for information that will provide parameters on positions such

                      to engage in the transaction? Consult with them as well as their colleagues, business
                      associates and friends to ascertain what motivates them. Ascertain their intention before
                      anything is put in writing. Have lunch together, play golf or engage in some activity that
                      allows people to relax, communicate and build trust-- the essential framework far an

                      (i.e., merger, sale of assets or sale of stock, structuring alternatives, broker
                      involvement, tax ramifications, debts, equity, employees, investment bankers, etc.) Make
                      sure that you make a comparative list of your issues and the issues that you think are

                      negotiating partner, compare and contrast those, as well. If you do not know their
                      position, consider what those might be by information that you have received from
                      others.&nbsp; Determine all interests that need to be satisfied and set forth your
                      beginning position. It is best to set high expectations so you leave room for bargaining
                      and compromise-- the closer you are to your bottom line when you begin, the less wiggle
                      room you have.&nbsp; Set forth what you believe is the most favorable position for your
                      opponent and what you believe his/her bottom line to be. But do not be persuaded or
                      influenced by the opponent's possible position-- create potions and alternatives to your
                      positions assuming that your most favorable position may not be acceptable. Analyze your
                      best alternative to a negotiated agreement and be willing to walk away and say no, if
                      there is no meeting of the minds or no creative options that will meet the interests of
                      all parties. </font></p>

                      Prepare written documentation, letters of intent, statistics, financial information, all
                      relevant documents, tax returns, etc. and objective information when ever possible to back
                      up your position. Have every document organized, and formulate a list of questions that
                      you need to ask.&nbsp; Prepare yourself emotionally, physically, and dress appropriately
                      and professionally to set up the ambiance of professionalism.</font></p>

                      the potential sale or purchase of the business.&nbsp; The effectiveness and success of
                      your negotiation will be determines by your readiness. Your skill, knowledge and

                      build the relationship and produce a satisfying agreement to accomplish the actual
