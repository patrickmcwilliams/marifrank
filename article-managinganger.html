                  the Anger of Divorce<br>
                  </strong></font><font color="#800000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">&quot;If you are
                  patient in one moment of anger, you will escape a hundred days of sorrow.&quot;<br>
                  - Chinese proverb <br>
                  </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">By Mari J. Frank </font></p>
                  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">It's a fact: escalating anger
                  causes much of the sorrow of divorce. You have the right to be upset -- but how can you
                  deal effectively with the ire in divorce? First, it's important to realize that anger is a
                  natural emotion, like an alarm meant to protect you from further hurt. Even the most
                  agreeable people have legitimate feelings of hostility in divorce. Why? Because your
                  expectations, dreams, and hopes about your life with your spouse are dissolving with the
                  divorce, and that is painful. Your wrath grows out of the feelings of disappointment of
                  perceived wrongs by your &quot;worse&quot; half. </font></p>
                  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Since anger is really unresolved
                  hurt without an outlet for healthy expression, repressed hostility causes an escalation of
                  conflict. As a result, the legitimate suffering that both parties experience in marital
                  discord often transforms into a stressful, expensive, &quot;bloody&quot; courtroom battle.
                  The litigated divorce provides a costly forum for acting out destructive animosity. </font></p>
                  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Mediation, a dynamic alternative
                  to litigation, is a facilitated negotiation. Successful mediation de-escalates the
                  hostility, focusing on problem solving instead of arguing positions. The mediator sifts
                  out blame and helps the parties discover mutually acceptable solutions. Due to the
                  intensity of the emotions -- and the complexity of the legal issues -- during divorce, the
                  parties need a qualified neutral attorney/mediator to educate them about family-law
                  issues. This process empowers both parties to make informed decisions about their children
                  and their finances. </font></p>
                  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The expert mediator facilitates
                  the transformation of conflict into &quot;solutioneering&quot; and teaches the parties how
                  to manage their own anger. It's a process that builds trust and guarantees satisfying
                  results. Handling your own anger effectively is a challenge at any time, but it is an
                  especially important accomplishment during the heat of divorce. </font></p>
                  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Whether you are in litigation or
                  mediation, it will be to your financial and emotional advantage to understand how to
                  control your frustrations. You can achieve greater financial benefits, save yourself from
                  stress, and &quot;win&quot; more of what you want if you can communicate effectively with
                  your spouse. </font></p>
                  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">For a long time, you and your
                  spouse have pushed each other's &quot;buttons&quot; and reacted to conflict by fighting,
                  fleeing, submitting, or freezing. When you repress anger, you feel diminished, yet if you
                  meet hostility with aggression, it fans the flame, which may lead to violence. There are
                  better options. </font></p>
                  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Our goal is to consciously
                  respond -- not instinctively react. If your spouse gets you mad, you have lost control of
                  yourself. As Elizabeth Kenny once said, &quot;He who angers you, conquers you.³ </font></p>
                  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When we allow our anger to rule
                  our reasoning, we lose our ability to make reliable decisions. We lose our sense of self,
                  our thinking becomes impaired, and we &quot;lose it.&quot; That's when we make &quot;the
                  greatest speeches we'll ever regret!³ We voluntarily give away our power when we delegate
                  the authority to anger to rule our reason. </font></p>
                  <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Try the following proven strategy
                  anytime your spouse (or children, boss, or anyone else) attacks your ideas, actions, or
                  beliefs. To help you remember this 10-step strategy, you may find the acronym HARD LOVING

                    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Halt</b> <br>
                      Halt: Stop yourself from reacting -- don't say anything. Listen, don't express negative
                      emotions, and consciously breathe slowly. If you react in anger, you will invite more
                      hostility. </font></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Anger contro</b>l <br>
                      Anger is a negative emotion that you can actually feel in your body. Immediately direct
                      your mind to your physical sensations. Some typical reactions are dryness in the throat,
                      tightness in the neck, knife in the solar plexus, etc. <br>
                      <br>
                      Take a moment to close your eyes (focus), and imagine your spouse saying something that
                      &quot;pushes your buttons.&quot; Identify your physical reaction to the verbal battle.
                      Once you recognize your body's auto-reply to verbal pain, you gain the key to override its
                      power over you. </font></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Reverse reaction</b><br>
                      You can consciously reverse this auto-reaction through your awareness. For example, if you
                      sense a knife in your solar plexus when you're feeling accused, gently &quot;remove the
                      weapon.&quot; &quot;Drink&quot; refreshing water for your dry throat. <br>
                      <br>
                      Deliberately take calm slow breaths as you make this reversal until you are calm and
                      centered. You still have not said a single word to the 'attacker'. With practice, this
                      gentle dissolving of your auto-reaction to conflict will take only a split second. Once
                      your body is tranquil, you will regain your composure. </font></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Disengage</b><br>
                      Now that you have detached physically, you are ready to disengage mentally. Focus on the
                      issue, not the person's words or behavior. Separate the person from the problem. Just
                      because your spouse says something offensive doesn't mean it is true or you have to accept
                      it as a fact. His/her perceptions are just thoughts. You don't have to be defensive or
                      convince him/her otherwise. Release any need to prove you are right: from your
                      perspective, you are right. Disengage from the tornado of hostility and the storm will
                      stop. If you don't engage, the fight has ended. When you let go, you disable your
                      &quot;opponent.&quot; He/she cannot control you if you don't get upset. In essence, you
                      win control, since the other person has succumbed to his/her own anger. </font></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Listen effectively</b><br>
                      Listen to every word without resistance. (This doesn't mean you agree!) Don't think of
                      your response. Listening demonstrates a willingness to understand, which promotes a
                      reciprocal receptivity. Non-contentious listening deflects hostility and gives you
                      powerful information to resolve the real issues. </font></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p class="Abyline" align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span
                      class="Abody"><b>Openly mirror</b></span><br>
                      Restate, in a calm, neutral tone, the essence of what was said. For example: &quot;You
                      stated that you were angry because you felt I spent too much money on the children.&quot;
                      Or: &quot;You are concerned that you will have to live in an unacceptable place because of
                      the divorce.&quot; By mirroring what the other person said, you have not agreed -- you are
                      merely demonstrating your understanding of what you heard. </font></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Voice open-ended questions<br>
                      </b>Follow up a mirrored statement with an open-ended question, such as: &quot;What do you
                      think is an appropriate amount to spend for the children? Please clarify.&quot; <br>
                      <br>
                      Information questions are simple but formidable. Pose clarifying questions like:
                      &quot;What do you mean?&quot; &quot;How will that work?&quot; &quot;When can you do
                      that?&quot; &quot;Can you tell me more about your proposal?&quot; and &quot;What is the
                      basis for your reasoning?&quot; These types of questions open the door to mutual
                      understanding and problem solving. </font></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Imagine solutions</b><br>
                      Upon hearing responses from the open-ended questions, the parties can shift to the
                      brainstorming stage of proposing various options for settlement. Both spouses need to
                      share: <br>
                      a) what they believe would be fair under the circumstances;<br>
                      b) what they really need -- and the basis for their suggested solution to the conflict;
                      and <br>
                      c) what would resolve the issues for everyone, so that both parties and others involved
                      would be able to accept the decisions agreed upon. </font></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Non-aggression</b> <br>
                      No matter how aggressive the other person may become, stay calm, keep breathing slowly,
                      and listen without engaging in anger. You may have to keep repeating steps one to four
                      throughout the discussion. </font></p>
                    </li>
                    <li><p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><b>Go away</b> <br>
                      If you find that the other person cannot act appropriately, remove yourself with dignity
                      before you get hooked into their frustration. Leave the situation (or calmly get off the
                      phone), allowing the other party to reconvene without groveling. You will have to deal
                      with your spouse in the future, so release your anger before you speak again. Then start
                      from step nine, and revive the problem-solving stage. Take a time-out, if necessary, to
                      make sure you both manage your own hostility. <br>
                      <br>
                      Anger is a tough feeling to understand, but it's important to remember that you are not
                      alone. Sometimes, you may believe you are furious at your spouse, but the problem is
                      similar to an issue that you had with a parent when you were a child. Our emotions of
                      challenging relationships need to be analyzed so we can learn important life lessons.
                      Emotional counseling during divorce is a helpful way to clarify which issues belong to you
                      and which are really dilemmas for your spouse. You are only responsible for 50% of the
                      problems in your marriage -- no more, no less. <br>
                      <br>
                      Seek quality individual therapy for yourself and, if you and your spouse are in agreement,
                      try marital counseling to work on your joint issues. If you are beyond the point of
                      marriage therapy, interview qualified attorney/mediators who have the skills to help you
                      to resolve the legal issues of the divorce and decrease the hostility between you. With an
                      innovative, holistic approach, you'll be able to &quot;heal&quot; the conflict so that you
                      both can release the hurt, forgive one another, and move on with your lives, productively,
                      to find new, healthy relationships. <br>
